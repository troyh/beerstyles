A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and German Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age. Gose is typically pale gold to pale amber in color and . typically contains malted barley, unmalted wheat with some traditional varieties containing oats. Hop character and malt flavors and aromas are negligible. Lemony or other citrus-like qualities are often present in aroma and on the palate. Some versions may have the spicy character of added coriander in aroma and on the palate at low to medium levels. Salt (table salt) character is also traditional in low amounts. Horsey, leathery, earthy aroma and flavors contributed by Brettanomyces yeasts may be evident but have a very low profile, as this beer is not excessively aged. Modern German Gose breweries typically introduce only pure beer yeast strains for fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh, carbonated, and cloudy/hazy with yeast character, and may have evidence of continued fermentation activity. Overall complexity of flavors and aromas are sought while maintaining an ideal balance between acidity, yeast-enhanced spice and refreshment is ideal. </div></div></div></div><div id="#14D" class="style"><div class="name">South German-Style Hefeweizen/Hefeweissbier</div><div class="category">Ale - German Origin 14D</div><div class="info"><div class="parameters"><div class="og">11.7&ndash;13.8&deg;P (1.047&ndash;1.056)</div><div class="fg">2.1&ndash;4.1&deg;P (1.008&ndash;1.016)</div><div class="ibu">10&ndash;15</div><div class="color">3&ndash;9</div><div class="abv">4.9&ndash;5.5</div></div><div class="descriptions"><div class="notes">The aroma and flavor of a Weissbier with yeast is decidedly fruity and phenolic.

This beer should be perceived as having low bitterness. Certain renditions of this beer style approach a perceivable level of hop flavor (note: hop flavor does not imply hop bitterness) and character but it is essentially balanced with malt character to retain its style identity. Helles Rauchbier malt character is reminiscent of freshly and very lightly toasted sweet malted barley. There should not be any caramel character. Color is light straw to golden. Noble-type hop flavor is low but may be perceptible. The aroma should strike a balance between malt, hop, and smoke. Fruity esters, diacetyl, and chill haze should not be perceived. </div></div></div></div><div id="#21M" class="style"><div class="name">Bamberg-Style Bock Rauchbier</div><div class="category">Lager Beer - European-germanic Origin 21M</div><div class="info"><div class="parameters"><div class="og">16.1&ndash;18.0&deg;P (1.066&ndash;1.074)</div><div class="fg">4.6&ndash;6.1&deg;P (1.018&ndash;1.024)</div><div class="ibu">20&ndash;30</div><div class="color">20&ndash;30</div><div class="abv">6&ndash;7.5</div></div><div class="descriptions"><div class="notes">Bamberg-style Bock Rauchbier should have beechwood smoky characters that range from detectable to prevalent in the aroma and flavor.

Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors. Primary character of the beer style may or may not be apparent. Sour Woodaged beer of any color is outlined in other categories. The brewer must explain the special nature of the beer to allow for accurate judging. Comments could include: type of wood used (new or old, oak or other wood type), type of barrel used (new, port/ whiskey/ wine/ sherry/ other), base beer style or achieved character. Beer entries not accompanied by this information will be at a disadvantage during judging. </div></div></div></div><div id="#32E" class="style"><div class="name">Wood and Barrel-Aged Sour Beer</div><div class="category">Hybrid/mixed Beer - Wood And Barrel Aged 32E</div><div class="info"><div class="parameters"></div><div class="descriptions"><div class="notes">A Wood or barrel-aged sour beer is any lager, ale or hybrid beer, either a traditional style or a unique experimental beer that has been aged for a period of time in a wooden barrel or in contact with wood and has developed a bacterial induced natural acidity. This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but Woodaged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting Woodflavors.  Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Woodderived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These Woodderived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as Woodderived flavors. Any degree of Woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and &quot;wild&quot; yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties). The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer. </div></div></div></div><div id="#32F" class="style"><div class="name">Aged Beer (Ale or Lager)</div><div class="category">Hybrid/mixed Beer - Wood And Barrel Aged 32F</div><div class="info"><div class="parameters"></div><div class="descriptions"></div></div></div></div></div><div id="footer"><img id="tagline" src="http://optimismbrewing.com/img/Choose-optimism-250.png"><div class="fineprint"><p>&copy;2014 Optimism Brewing Company</p></div></div></div></body></html>
